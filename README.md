# Development of a Digital Identity Management System Using Blockchain

## Overview

This project aims to develop a **Digital Identity Management System** leveraging the power of **Blockchain technology** to ensure secure, immutable, and transparent management of digital identities. By using blockchain, the system allows individuals to control their identity data, reduce the risks of identity theft, and enable seamless digital authentication across various services.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Built with **Next.js** for a fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly user interface.
- **Backend**: **Go (Golang)** is used for the backend API, ensuring high performance and concurrency handling.
- **Blockchain**: The system uses **Solidity** for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, enabling decentralized identity management.
- **Web3**: To interact with the blockchain and handle user authentication and identity operations.
- **Database**: You can use a database like **PostgreSQL** or **MongoDB** for storing off-chain data, such as user metadata and transaction records.

## Features

- **Decentralized Identity Management**: Users manage their identities without relying on centralized entities. The blockchain guarantees the authenticity and immutability of identity data.
- **Secure Authentication**: The blockchain enables secure authentication, reducing reliance on traditional passwords and centralized systems.
- **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)**: Users control their identity data, granting or revoking access to services without relying on intermediaries.
- **Immutable and Transparent**: All identity-related actions (such as creation, updates, and verification) are recorded on the blockchain, providing an immutable audit trail.
- **Smart Contracts**: Smart contracts automate identity management processes securely and without intermediaries.

## Requirements

To run this project locally, you will need the following:

- **Node.js** (v16 or later)
- **Next.js** for the frontend
- **Go (Golang)** for the backend API
- **Solidity** for writing Ethereum smart contracts
- **Truffle** or **Hardhat** for Ethereum smart contract development
- **Metamask** or any Web3-enabled wallet for interacting with the blockchain
- **Ganache** (for local blockchain development) or access to a public Ethereum test network (e.g., Rinkeby, Goerli)
